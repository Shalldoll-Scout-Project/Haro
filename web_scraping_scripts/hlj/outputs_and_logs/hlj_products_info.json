The head and neck can be articulated in four axes, allowing for various dynamic poses such as tilting the chin or looking up towards the sky.The Barbatos is equipped with a wide range of motion achieved by incorporating movable axes within the torso, enabling swinging from left to right and forward and backward tilting. The movement of the chest is synchronized with the expansion and contraction of the side abdominal cylinders. The shoulder connection utilizes a swing mechanism, enhancing the range of motion for the arms. The cylinder on the elbow moves in tandem with the arm, providing synchronized articulation.Featuring the unique MGSD original gimmick, pulling down the lower part of the shoulder armor activates the linked expansion of the central armor. The knee armor moves in conjunction with the bending of the legs, while the armor on the back of the knee can move independently without hindering the leg's motion.The twin eyes are created using a double-layer structure, combining intricately detailed internal parts with clear parts for a stunning visual effect.MGSD original clear parts with precision-shaped processing, designed to efficiently reflect light, are employed on the chest, knees, and shoulders, introducing a shining technique.The Barbatos also utilizes the \"Real Metallic Gloss Injection\" material in glossy injection molding, enhancing the metallic sheen on the fine details.The backpack allows for mounting a sword, a 300mm smoothbore gun, and a mace. The 300mm smoothbore gun can be transformed into a storage state by extending the barrel and rotating it 180 degrees.The mace features an MGSD original gimmick where pushing the handle extends the tip and unfolds four blades in synchronized motion.[Included Accessories]Mace x 1Sword x 1300mm Smoothbore Gun x 1Joint Parts Set x 1Marking Sticker Sheet x 1Please note that the first release of this item may be limited, and in some cases it may not be possible to fill all orders at the time of its initial release.

The PG Unleashed RX-78-2 Gundam is history-making in its number of gimmicks and new technologies, resulting in a splendid build like you've never seen before!It features the Gunpla Evolution Link System, which adopts a step-by-step assembly process to simulate the experience of building a real Mobile Suit! Its internal frame, which serves as its skeleton, is assembled in the earliest stage in the history of the Perfect Grade lineup, and it's also the largest frame in the history of Gunpla, with a total height of about 18cm. The kit will have over 90 points of articulation after assembly -- the largest number of joints in Gunpla history! -- for extreme posability! Its fuselage, which uses a core block mechanism, uses a new structure that combines 40 joints.\u00a0Metallic molding color and plated parts are used for the multi-layer truss frame to create four distinct metallic expressions; three kinds of secondary processing such as silver plating, matte plating and chrome plating are combined with metal parts and newly developed etched seals to make the Gundam look even more amazing than ever before.In addition, this kit is equipped with the most full-body open-hatch gimmicks ever seen in a Gundam kit, and it also includes a new LED unit! The unit includes a new compact RGB two-lamp type LED light that enables color change, and a design that maximizes its efficiency. A very small lighting unit is also installed in the beam saber! The beam blade will be lit from the base in a gradation for ultimate realism. A pin-type BR435 lithium battery (one test battery included) and two LR41 button-cell batteries (not included, sold separately) are required for the light effects.Don't miss out on this ultimate Gundam kit -- order yours now![Includes]:Beam rifleBeam saber (x2)LED beam saberShieldCore fighterRBG 2-lamp LEDInterchangeable hands, left and right (x4 each)Figure (x4) (Amuro standing x1, sitting x2; Seira standing)Metal parts for vernier (x2)Metal parts for Vulcan (x2)Saber assembly auxiliary jigPin-type BR435 lithium batter for testMagnet unitMetal plate for magnet (x2)Marking stickerName sealEtching stickerMetallic 3D stickerInstruction manual",

It's highly articulated, incredibly posable, cleverly designed, and a joy to build. Now, as part of its Gunpla 30th Anniversary campaign, Bandai has released this beauty in Titanium Finish! The Titanium Finish is gorgeous and really stands out even under low lighting.It is still capable of striking more dynamic and realistic poses than an MG release ever could before! The transformable Core Fighter can be docked inside Gundam to become its cockpit, just like in the show. Gundam's movements are not restricted even when the Core Fighter is docked inside its torso, thanks to its ingeniously designed and intricately detailed inner frame!The Mobile Suit's armaments include a beam rifle with removable super napalm attachment, two beam sabers, shield, hyper bazooka, Gundam Hammer, and beam javelin. Marking stickers, foil stickers, and dry transfer stickers are included, along with three unpainted 1/100 figures of Amuro Ray, two standing (casual wear and pilot suit) and one sitting. Make this the centerpiece of your Gunpla collection!",

Bandai's Gunpla 30th Anniversary campaign has seen some stellar releases and now we are being treated to the Extra Finish Version of the Perfect Grade RX-78-2! Molded in a special finish that really gleams under lighting, this Gundam is otherwise identical to the original kit released in 1998 and features an incredible level of INNER detail. Just about everything you could hope for in terms of detail and poseability is here. Even little actuators in some joints slide in and out like hydraulic pistons when you move them (wrists, etc.). What's more, a watch battery (CR1220) lights the eyes in the head, activated by a tiny switch on the back. Other gimmicks include wings on the core fighter which fold automatically when you tuck in the nose for docking. For a true Gundam hobbyist, there's simply no question about whether you should order this! Even if you don't plan on painting or gluing anything, you should prepare yourself for several evenings of snipping, trimming and snapping before your masterpiece is completed. There are, after all, 626 parts on 23 runners which combine to form a model that stands nearly 31cm high and 13cm wide with 66 moving joints and 29 opening hatches. What fun!Also available in an Extra Finish Version, the Zaku II (linked below).",

Now, as part of the Gunpla 30th Anniversary campaign, Bandai is pulling out all the stops and offering them together in one set! This set also features special clear armor parts (in place of the \"regular\" armor parts...only the clear armor parts are icluded), making it all the more unique.The enjoyment found in constructing a Perfect Grade kit isn't necessarily found in its size but in the engineering and design used to create these highly articulated machines. Now that engineering know-how is on display with the use of the clear armor parts allowing viewers to see what is going on \"under the skin.\"The \"camera eyes\" light up with internal wiring and a single LED. Not surprisingly, a lot of parts are required to create the exquisite detail we've come to associate with the Perfect Grade series -- over 550 ABS plastic parts, plus polycaps for the joints, die-cast joint parts for stability, and of course the LED and wiring for the head (requires one CR1220 watch-type battery, sold separately). Parts are included for a Beam Rifle, shield, Armor-Schneider blades, and of course the positively enormous Grand Slam sword -- this last beautifully plated in silver! The PG Skygrasper also comes with the Aile Striker; you can build and display them both on the included display base, or integrate them into your PG Gundam. A truly special set!",

This Master Grade release of the prototype artillery Mobile Suit comes in snap-fit plastic parts molded in color and will be fully poseable upon completion. It features suspension caterpillar treads that rotate realistically and has suspension arms inside the treads that allow for it to be displayed traversing over uneven terrains, plus its head console lights up through the use of an included LED unit (two coin batteries required, not included).Guntank also sports a Core Block System whereby the included FF-X7 Core Fighter can transform and dock inside its torso. It utilizes the same Core Fighter as MG RX-78-2 Gundam Ver.2.0 and MG G-Fighter (linked below), which means Gundan's upper body can be attached to Guntank's treads to form Gundam Tank, while Guntank's upper body can be attached to G-Fighter to form a high mobility-type Guntank! Also packed in this set are same-scale pilots consisting of three sitting-pose pilots (Hayato, Ryu, and a regular pilot), and standing-pose figures of Bright, Mirai, Ryu, and Hayato.

It can hold various dynamic action poses as well as signature stances seen in the show, and detail is spot on with intricate mechanisms realized on its highly-articulated inner frame as we've come to expect from an MG release. Clear green lenses are provided for its chest, and sides of its head, elbows, and knees, while all cord sections on the body utilizes hologram parts and clear parts so you can view its mechanisms underneath.Its complete Seven Sword System is provided consisting of a GN Long Blade, a GN Short Blade, two GN Beam Daggers, two GN Beam Sabers, a GN Sword that can switch between rifle mode and gun mode, plus a GN Shield with sides that can slide out. A dedicated clear base is also included for displaying the detachable GN Drive, and a red cover part can be attached to the back of Gundam Exia in place of the GN Drive. Two same-scale figures (molded in white) of Setsuna in standing and sitting poses are packed in the set along with foil stickers, dry transfer stickers, and MG Gundam Exia original marking stickers for detail.",

Once assembled it will stand 37.5cm (almost 15 inches) tall, but perhaps the most impressive aspect of this monstrous kit is that you don't need any tools! That's right! The pieces attach to the runner by a very thin length of plastic so you can break the pieces off with your hands! If some parts prove difficult for you, Bandai has even included a 'Double Separator' tool! To make things even easier, Bandai has made it so that you can snap two runners together and then remove the individual pieces. This must be the 'double' in the 'Double Separator\". What a time saver! There are even icons on the runners to indicate which part of the kit the pieces are for. Of course, the 1/48 Gundam comes with two 1/48 beam sabers and his large (even larger now) beam rifle, and shield. \u00a0Don't be intimidated by its size, this kit is a snap!",

The clear armor parts come molded on one plastic runner. Everything else remains the same as its initial release.A Mobile Suit made famous at the hands of ace pilot Lieutenant Ramba Ral, the MS-07B Gouf is a high-performance machine that strikes fear in its opponents with its powerful Heat Saber and Heat Rod at its disposal. This much-anticipated \"Version 2.0\" update to its 2000-released Master Grade kit not only utilizes the same amazingly detailed and super-poseable inner frame from MG MS-06J Zaku II Ver. 2.0, Bandai went a step further in enhancing the inner frame to allow for wider range of posing possibilities and smoother movements! Both the front and side skirt armor parts are linked together so that the side skirt armor will slide back when the front skirt armor is moved upwards so as to not restrict the Mobile Suit's movements.In pursuit of easing the assembly process for modelers, Bandai came up with an ingenious method of molding each individual section of the pipe cover in straight rows on the plastic runner so you can easily insert the power pipe through each row of pipe covers and snap each of them off without having to individually cut and slide each piece to the power pipe! That'll shave off at least a few minutes of assembly time!Its signature weaponry includes a shield, a Heat Saber, a Heat Rod, and a Finger Vulcan for its left hand. A regular manipulator left hand is also included to replace the Finger Vulcan if you so desire. Each section of the Heat Rod is ball-jointed so you can bend it into any shape you want! The blade part of the Heat Saber is made of clear orange, and the Mobile Suit's cockpit can slide open to reveal a sitting-pose pilot figure (molded in light blue).

Newly-designed joints allow it incredibly realistic posing -- especially in the legs. A tighter bend at the knee, and a joint that divides the heel and toe of the foot, provides better balance for \"action\" poses, and gives your Mk-II a realistic appearance when it's crouching, as though it's about to spring into action at any time! The kit is all molded in color and snaps together; vinyl tubing is included for weapons detail. Also included is a catapult display stand -- and three scale figures (one pilot and two maintenance crew) for positioning around the Mk-II while it's \"docked.\" Not just an improvement on the original kit, the Version 2.0 takes the Mk-II to a whole new level!",

        "description": "Description\nThis is a posable, Master-Grade injection-plastic kit of an item from the Gundam universe. \n\nFinally completing Bandai's Master Grade (MG) release of all three \"Project V\" Mobile Suits, here's the long-awaited 1/100-scale plastic kit release of Guntank done in perfect MG justice! A fusion of a tank with the upper body and arms of a Mobile Suit, the Guntank was the first Earth Federation Mobile Suit produced under \"Project V.\" It served admirably protecting White Base and fighting alongside Gundam and Guncannon during the One Year War in the 1979-80 \"Mobile Suit Gundam\" anime. This Master Grade release of the prototype artillery Mobile Suit comes in snap-fit plastic parts molded in color and will be fully poseable upon completion. It features suspension caterpillar treads that rotate realistically and has suspension arms inside the treads that allow for it to be displayed traversing over uneven terrains, plus its head console lights up through the use of an included LED unit (two coin batteries required, not included). Guntank also sports a Core Block System whereby the included FF-X7 Core Fighter can transform and dock inside its torso. It utilizes the same Core Fighter as MG RX-78-2 Gundam Ver.2.0 and MG G-Fighter, which means Gundan's upper body can be attached to Guntank's treads to form Gundam Tank, while Guntank's upper body can be attached to G-Fighter to form a high mobility-type Guntank! Also packed in this set are same-scale pilots consisting of three sitting-pose pilots (Hayato, Ryu, and a regular pilot), and standing-pose figures of Bright, Mirai, Ryu, and Hayato. Dry-transfer decals and marking stickers are provided.",

        "description": "Description\nThis is a posable, Master-Grade injection-plastic kit of an item from the Gundam universe. \n\nA Mobile Suit made famous at the hands of ace pilot Lieutenant Ramba Ral, the MS-07B Gouf is a high-performance machine that strikes fear in its opponents with its powerful Heat Saber and Heat Rod at its disposal. This much-anticipated \"Version 2.0\" update to its 2000-released Master Grade kit not only utilizes the same amazingly detailed and super-poseable inner frame from MG MS-06J Zaku II Ver. 2.0, Bandai went a step further in enhancing the inner frame to allow for wider range of posing possibilities and smoother movements! Both the front and side skirt armor parts are linked together so that the side skirt armor will slide back when the front skirt armor is moved upwards so as to not restrict the Mobile Suit's movements. In pursuit of easing the assembly process for modelers, Bandai came up with an ingenious method of molding each individual section of the pipe cover in straight rows on the plastic runner so you can easily insert the power pipe through each row of pipe covers and snap each of them off without having to individually cut and slide each piece to the power pipe! That'll shave off at least a few minutes of assembly time! Its signature weaponry includes a shield, a Heat Saber, a Heat Rod, and a Finger Vulcan for its left hand. A regular manipulator left hand is also included to replace the Finger Vulcan if you so desire. Each section of the Heat Rod is ball-jointed so you can bend it into any shape you want! The blade part of the Heat Saber is made of clear orange, and the Mobile Suit's cockpit can slide open to reveal a sitting-pose pilot figure (molded in light blue). Also packed in the set are in-scale figures (molded in light blue) of Ramba Ral and his aide Crowley Hamon. A sheet of stickers and dry-transfer markings are included.",

Now, numerous MG Gundam incarnations and 13 years later, Bandai has given the iconic First Gundam a Version 2.0 upgrade with today's MG standards in poseability and detailing! This much-anticipated offering is designed with amazingly accurate detailing and proportion to its TV counterpart in the 1979-80 \"Mobile Suit Gundam\" series. The snap-fit plastic parts come molded in color so no painting is necessary. A new inner frame was developed for this release, capable of striking more dynamic and realistic poses than an MG release ever could before! The transformable Core Fighter can be docked inside Gundam to become its cockpit, just like in the show. Gundam's movements are not restricted even when the Core Fighter is docked inside its torso, thanks to its ingeniously designed and intricately detailed inner frame!The Mobile Suit's armaments include a beam rifle with removable super napalm attachment, two beam sabers, shield, hyper bazooka, Gundam Hammer, and beam javelin. Marking stickers, foil stickers, and dry transfer stickers are included, along with three unpainted (molded in white) 1/100 figures of Amuro Ray, two standing (casual wear and pilot suit) and one sitting.

Weapons include its Nichirinmaru katana with sheath, Denkoumaru naginata, Sankoumaru jumonji yari, and a Tanegashima gun. The blades for each melee weapon have silver mekki plating for extra realism! Marking stickers and Gundam decals are provided for added detail and give you the choice of completing the kit with either Hajime Katoki's markings or the plastic model kit original-version markings!",

Based on the version in the \"M.S.V.\" (Mobile Suit Variations) series, this highly anticipated update of 1999's MG MS-06R Zaku II Black Trinity has sharp new features made possible by today's advanced injection molding technology: individually articulated fingers (no more swapping around with other fixed-pose optional hands!); cockpit hatch that slides up to reveal the detailed cockpit; pilot seat that can switch sides from left to right by turning a lever; and best of all, its inner mechanical frame and overall body design uses the same molds as the MG Zaku II Ver. 2.0 that boasts wildly articulated joints to set it in just about any action pose you can think of! This is not only a great improvement over the 1999 MG kit, but is also more accurately detailed to its M.S.V. design!This space-type Mobile Suit is a distinctively customized Zaku II with the Black Trinity's color scheme, additional thrusters on its legs, and a jet pack attachment on its back for increased mobility.

Weapons and accessories include a heat hawk, Zaku machine gun, giant bazooka rocket version, Zaku bazooka, and two types of blade antennas (normal type and stabilizer type). Six 1/100-scale unpainted Black Trinity pilot figures--two apiece of Gaia, Ortega, and Mash (one standing and one sitting)--complete this highly recommended kit!

Featured in Yoshiyuki Tomino's \"Turn A Gundam\" series, this \"mustachioed\" Mobile Suit was designed by Syd Mead (whose work can be seen in such movies as \"Aliens,\" \"Blade Runner,\" and \"Tron\") in a unique departure from the conventional Gundam designs in the franchise. This fantastically detailed kit is packed with abundant features that showcase the hallmarks of the Master Grade series. Every movement that Turn A Gundam can do in the show can be replicated in this kit, thanks to its flexible joints located throughout the body without any armor pieces getting in the way. As seen in the show, the cockpit can be turned into a Core Fighter, thruster vanes on the back of the legs are movable, hatches located on the back can be opened when executing its \"Moonlight Butterfly\" attack, and hatches located on the chest can be opened to reveal missiles with multipurpose missile silos--and if you're like me and have been aching to recreate the cow-transporting scene from episode 8, just remove those missile silos, insert the included 1/100-scale cow (molded in white), and let the good times roll!Turn A Gundam comes armed with a beam rifle, two beam sabers, a Gundam hammer, and a shield. Both the beam rifle and shield can be mounted on its back. A foil sticker is included along with a sheet of decals for custom markings.The item shown is a pre-production sample.

Newly-designed joints allow it incredibly realistic posing -- especially in the legs. A tighter bend at the knee, and a joint that divides the heel and toe of the foot, provides better balance for \"\"action\"\" poses, and gives your Mk-II a realistic appearance when it's crouching, as though it's about to spring into action at any time! The kit is all molded in colour and snaps together; vinyl tubing is included for weapons detail. Also included is a catapult display stand -- and three scale figures (one pilot and two maintenance crew) for positioning around the Mk-II while it's \"docked.\" Not just an improvement on the original kit, the Version 2.0 takes the Mk-II to a whole new level! It's only available in A.E.U.G. colours for now (but will probably come out in Titans colours soon!).",

Panels on the legs flip open to reveal internal mechanisms.  The head has a panel, too.  Even the \"Core Fighter\" cockpit ship can be removed from its belly.  Fine mesh parts cover the inside of the chest air intakes for added realism.  Three types of hands are included -- open palm, fists, and posable (moving fingers) for gripping any of the several weapons that comes with the kit.All of Bandai's MG (as well as HG) kits are completely snap-together, and parts are molded in color, so no painting is necessary.  Of course, the use of cement and paints will improve the appearance of a finished model.  Many of the surface markings are printed right onto the plastic parts to begin with, but the kit includes replacement transfers for those people who wish to paint their work.The RX-78-3 kit is identical to the RX-78-2 except that it is molded in blue and gray plastic, rather than the more \"festive\" colors of the original.",

Weapons include the Giant Bazooka Prototype, standard Bazooka, \"Heat Hawk\" axe, and the sub-machine gun. This kit also comes with a figure of the pilot \"Mush\" (great name).Like all the kits in the MG series, the level of detail is superb, and virtually everything moves. The pipes running from the thighs to the calves, as well as around the sides of the head, are flexible springs covered with plastic tubes. The head has a panel that opens, and a small tab on the back of the head lets you position the Zaku's scanner eye. Three types of hands are included: open palm, fists, and posable (moving fingers).All of Bandai's MG (as well as HG) kits are completely snap-together, and parts are molded in color, so no painting is necessary.

Not a speck of detail is lost, even in this fairly small scale; The G Fighter can transform into the G Blue, G Blue E-z, G Sky, and G Sky E-z, when completed.  The RX-78-2 is transformable, too (well, its lower half comes off!) to allow you to build the Gundam Sky.  Neat PVC caterpillar tracks are included for the G Blue and G Blue E-z (the tracks can also be retracted into the body of the main machine), and an unbuilt display base allows you to show off the various modes to their very best effect!  Of course all the parts are molded in coloured plastic, and snap together, so no paint or glue are required.  Polycaps are included for all the movable joints; foil stickers are included for detail.  Don't miss out on this terrific set!",

This kit also comes with a figure of the pilot \"Mush\" (great name).Like all the kits in the MG series, the level of detail is superb, and virtually everything moves. The pipes running from the thighs to the calves, as well as around the sides of the head, are flexible springs covered with plastic tubes. The head has a panel that opens, and a small tab on the back of the head lets you position the Zaku's scanner eye. Three types of hands are included: open palm, fists, and posable (moving fingers).All of Bandai's MG (as well as HG) kits are completely snap-together, and parts are molded in color, so no painting is necessary. Of course, the use of cement and paint will improve the appearance of a finished model.",

Panels and hatches all over the surface open, to reveal inner mechanical details. What's more, after you get done wading through over two dozen runners of literally thousands of parts, you'll have armament for the GP01 including two 60mm Vulcans, two beam sabers, and a beam rifle, as well as the Core Fighter II. For the GP01Fb, there are two extra beam guns, and you can build the Core Fighter II Fb. But that's not all -- the kit also includes the parts to build a hangar/dock (see photos below), with little figures of maintenance workers to position around it! A bonus card with a serial number on it also included.

Molded in pre-colored plastic with Bandai's fantastic multi-gate technology (which allows multiple colors on the same tree), there are four trees (a lot for such a teeny kit!), and one tree of polycaps for the joints.  Included for limited customisation are two left hands and two right hands, in day-glo orange plastic so you can pretend he's powering up with the mighty God Finger -- what?  You want non-glowy hands?  Not included, unfortunately!  Despite all the photos on the box and in the instructions booklet, there are no grey/non-glowing hands in this kit.  A note on the side of the box points out that the MG God Gundam hand parts will fit just fine, if you don't want your SD God Gundam hands to 'glow'.Though the entire kit is cast in colored plastic, you can certainly paint it if you wish, for a more accurate representation of the mech; a painting guide is included in the instructions (though all text is in Japanese).

Panels on the legs flip open to reveal internal mechanisms.  The head has a panel, too.  Even the \"Core Fighter\" cockpit ship can be removed from its belly.  Fine mesh parts cover the inside of the chest air intakes for added realism.  Three types of hands are included -- open palm, fists, and posable (moving fingers) for gripping any of the several weapons that comes with the kit.All of Bandai's MG (as well as HG) kits are completely snap-together, and parts are molded in color, so no painting is necessary.  Of course, the use of cement and paints will improve the appearance of a finished model.  Many of the surface markings are printed right onto the plastic parts to begin with, but the kit includes replacement transfers for those people who wish to paint their work.The RX-78-3 kit is identical to the RX-78-2 except that it is molded in blue and gray plastic, rather than the more \"festive\" colors of the original.",

Like other MG kits, inner mechanical details and opening hatches are to be found throughout the model.Molded in color and featuring snap-together assembly, this model looks great just stuck together right out of the box.

The waist joints even allow it to bend side to side, and twist realistically! The \"camera eyes\" light up with internal wiring and a single LED. Not surprisingly, a lot of parts are required to create the exquisite detail we've come to associate with the Perfect Grade series -- over 550 ABS plastic parts, all molded in colour, plus polycaps for the joints, die-cast joint parts for stability, and of course the LED and wiring for the head (requires one CR1220 watch-type battery, sold separately). Parts are included for a Beam Rifle, shield, Armor-Schneider blades, and of course the positively enormous Grand Slam sword -- this last beautifully plated in silver! A challenging project for fans of Gundam, of Gundam SEED in particular, or just Perfect Grade kits! Please note: the 1/60 Strike Gundam Striker Weapon System (BAN917987) was not designed for use with the Perfect Grade kit, but for the previously-released 1/60 Strike Gundam kit with which it was issued.",

So far we've had \"Gundam 0080\" and \"Gundam 0083.\"  Now Sunrise (the company which produces Gundam) is cranking out \"The 08th MS Team\". Unlike the recent TV shows which have been set in some alternate Gundam universe unrelated to the original show and the \"One Year War\" featured in it, 08th MS Team is the One Year War.  Featuring ground combat between Gundams and Zakus running around in jungles, it has quite a different, more claustrophobic feel from that of the space-based shows we've seen so much of lately.The GM seems to exist only to get blown up by bad guys -- at least that's been its fate historically in the Gundam universe.

Accessories include its shield, beam rifle, beam saber and beam naginata, a variation on a traditional Japanese long-handled sword.Other features of the kit are standard for the MG series: Snap assembly, pre-colored parts, fully posable, three types of hands, etc. Also includes two tiny little Char figures.",

        "description": "Description\nThis is a posable, Master-Grade injection-plastic kit of an item from the Gundam universe. \n\n             Zeta Gundam was broadcast on Japanese TV during '84/85, following up the original series with a whole new set of characters and machines.  Not surprisingly, the robot of the same name was the main piece of hardware in the show.  This new show also introduced the \"transformation\" concept to Gundam, and the Zeta does an impressive one, switching from robot mode to \"Wave Rider\" mode in the wink of an eye.  Perhaps more impressive is the fact the this Master Grade kit can also make this transformation without a single piece having to be removed or replaced on it (not counting the shield/nose piece, but that's true to the show).This version of the 1/100 MG Zeta Gundam is the test version as it appeared at Anaheim Electronics during the initial phases of the project.Eight full-size runners with hundreds of multi-colored parts make this kit a serious assembly project, but it goes together very smoothly. Besides the transformation capability, the kit includes all kinds of other goodies.  As usual, everything moves.  Even those antenna on its forehead fold up.  Three sets of hands are included -- fists, open palm, and posable.  Also includes the usual \"beam saber\" sword, dual Vulcan cannon, beam rifle and shield. All of Bandai's MG (as well as HG) kits are completely snap-together, and parts are molded in color, so no painting is necessary.  Of course, the use of cement and paints will improve the appearance of a finished model.  Many of the surface markings are printed right onto the plastic parts to begin with, but the kit includes replacement transfers for those people who wish to paint their work.",

Includes the Zaku machine gun and \"heat hawk\" axe weapon. When completed, the kit stands 30cm tall and weighs about 500g. There are a whopping 548 pieces here, so be ready to spend some time putting this together (completion of mine, snap assembly only, took about 12 hours!). Includes figure of Char Aznable.",

Made up of 11 runners of injection plastic and one runner of polycaps, with two small sets of decals for detail, this is easily one of the most complex of the Gundam versions.  Have fun putting it all together!  Lots of poseability thanks to polycaps at the joints.  Just a quick note -- though this is a Master Grade kit, unlike other recent MG kits it does not feature the inner-frame system we've gotten used to (this keeps the kit a little simpler, and keeps the cost down for you!).",

        "description": "Description\nThis is a posable, Perfect-Grade injection-plastic kit of an item from the Gundam universe. \n\n             Things don't get much better than this for Gundam fans.The kit that Bandai has produced is truly amazing.  The most striking aspect is the incredible level of INNER detail.  It's almost a shame to put any of the cover panels on this thing, because there is so much on the inside that a little silver and black paint will make very interesting to look at.  Bandai is aware of this, and is also going to market an optional parts set for the kit that includes transparent body pieces!  This is due in December, we're told.  That set will also include a light-up beam saber.What can you say about this kit?  Though some weapons are not included (no doubt for a later release), it's just about everything you could hope for in terms of detail and poseability.  Even little actuators in some joints slide in and out like hydraulic pistons when you move them (wrists, etc.).  What's more, a watch battery (CR1220) lights the eyes in the head, activated by a tiny switch on the back.  Other gimmicks include wings on the core fighter which fold automatically when you tuck in the nose for docking.  For a true Gundam hobbyist, there's simply no question about whether you should order this.  Even if you don't plan on painting or gluing anything, you should prepare yourself for several evenings of snipping, trimming and snapping before your masterpiece will be completed.  There are, after all, 626 parts on 23 runners which combine to form a model that stands nearly 31cm high and 13cm wide with 66 moving joints and 29 opening hatches.  What fun!",

Superb tooling from Bandai ensures quality and detail, and their multi-gate technology allows several colors to be blown on a single runner, which reduces the number of necessary runners.  The completed kit is highly poseable thanks to plenty of polycaps in the joints; the 'wings' open and close, and the plasma rifles fold up and over the mech's shoulders to be used in combat.  Included is an unpainted plastic figure of Lacus Clyne, standing prettily and holding Haro in her hands.",

So far we've had \"Gundam 0080\" and \"Gundam 0083.\"  Now Sunrise (the company which produces Gundam) is cranking out \"The 08th MS Team\". Unlike the recent TV shows which have been set in some alternate Gundam universe unrelated to the original show and the \"One Year War\" featured in it, 08th MS Team is the One Year War.  Featuring ground combat between Gundams and Zakus running around in jungles, it has quite a different, more claustrophobic feel from that of the space-based shows we've seen so much of lately.The first kit related to the show is the Gundam vs. Zaku II set -- a unique kit in two way.  First of all, it contains two complete \"Mobile Suit\" kits, the RX-79 Gundam, and a MS-06J Zaku II (both shown above).  The second reason it's unique is that the two kits are both \"HG\" grade.  A step down from the awesome \"MG\" kits, but far better than the little 500 yen 1/144 kits we usually see.  Besides the two robots, the kit also includes a number of accessories, including the Gundam's back-mounted cargo container, and eight different weapons for the two protagonists.  All-in-all, a pretty good deal for 1,500 yen.  This kit is available now.",

Even if you don't paint or glue this kit (naturally it's all snap-assembly), it's going to take a few hours to put it together properly.As usual, everything on the kit moves. Those shoulder \"binders\" are particularly interesting, especially the way the outer nozzle pivots downward. The \"atomic bazooka\" can be mounted in the hand in firing position, or it breaks down into two pieces, the barrel mounting in the inside of the shield (see photo), with the remainder mounting on the GP02's back.Comes with the usual stickers, inner-mechanism detail, multiple sets of hands, beam saber, and stuff I've probably overlooked.",

Included weapons are the built-in machine cannons (in the shoulders), two Beam Sabres, and the Twin Buster Rifles. A custom display stand (unassembled and unpainted) is included so you can pose the finished mecha in any number of mid-flight poses, while keeping it safe. A super-tiny scale figure (unpainted) of Hiiro Yui is included as well.

The Master Grade series that was born from that idea has, without exaggeration, literally fueled much of the growth of HobbyLink Japan itself!And now, stolen right from the world of computer software, comes another idea that may also prove to be a very good one: Upgrades! \"Version 1.5\" of the RX-78-2 Gundam kit is, with the exception of the arms, an entirely new kit. The proportions of the item have changed to bring it more in line with the Perfect Grade kit of the same mecha. But perhaps most importantly, Bandai has attempted to address one of the biggest troubles that plague posable robot kits -- joints that are too soft -- by creating a one-piece, almost pre-assembled inner leg mechanism that is very firm -- ready to stay put in whatever pose you want it to. Not only that, it doubles as a very cool-looking inner mechanism for when you want to display your kit with the panels open or removed. As usual, you also get a bunch of fun weapons, including the beam rifle, bazooka, a Gundam Hammer with a plastic chain, a new beam javelin, and of course, beam sabers. And like the first release, the Core Fighter is removable. What's stopping you...order your upgrade today!",

A dozen or so runners of parts plus poly-caps combine to form a fully-posable and exquisitely-detailed model of the refurbished main mecha from Gundam 0083. Besides the standard beam saber, shield and rifle accessories, the \"Core Fighter\" and \"Core Block Thruster\" pulls out of the middle of the model and transforms into a jet fighter-type vehicle. Like other MG kits, inner mechanical details and opening hatches are to be found throughout the model.Molded in color and featuring snap-together assembly, this model looks great just stuck together right out of the box. Of course, for a truly professional appearance, you'll also want to use glue and paint. Foil sticker, dry transfer and clear sticker markings are included.",

        "description": "Description\nThis is a posable, Master-Grade injection-plastic kit of an item from the Gundam universe. \n\n             Zeta Gundam was broadcast on Japanese TV during '84/85, following up the original series with a whole new set of characters and machines.  Not surprisingly, the robot of the same name was the main piece of hardware in the show.  This new show also introduced the \"transformation\" concept to Gundam, and the Zeta does an impressive one, switching from robot mode to \"Wave Rider\" mode in the wink of an eye.  Perhaps more impressive is the fact the this new Master Grade kit can also make this transformation without a single piece having to be removed or replaced on it (not counting the shield/nose piece, but that's true to the show).The new 1/100 MG Zeta Gundam is probably the most highly-engineered model Bandai has ever produced. Eight full-size runners with hundreds of multi-colored parts make this kit a serious assembly project, but it goes together very smoothly. Besides the transformation capability, the kit includes all kinds of other goodies.  As usual, everything moves.  Even those yellow antenna on its forehead fold up.  Three sets of hands are included -- fists, open palm, and posable.  A watch battery can be installed to light up the cockpit of the Wave Rider (bulb included).  And the kit also comes with the \"Hyper Mega Launcher\" (not shown in these photos and yes, that's really what it's called) -- a huge super-cannon that the Zeta uses to blast enemies from the sky in one shot (the cannon is about 30cm or 12\" long when completed!).  Also includes the usual \"beam saber\" sword, and little grenades that fit into operable hatches on the ends of its forearms. The Zeta in \"Wave Rider\" mode, seen from the top and bottom.  This transformation takes place without any parts needing to be removed from the kit!All of Bandai's MG (as well as HG) kits are completely snap-together, and parts are molded in color, so no painting is necessary.  Of course, the use of cement and paints will improve the appearance of a finished model.  Many of the surface markings are printed right onto the plastic parts to begin with, but the kit includes replacement transfers for those people who wish to paint their work.",

Over 739 parts on 30 trees of injection molded and ABS plastic. 2 books - one on the construction and one on the history of the mech with color art. A very large press-on markings sheet that is unbelievably detailed. The skeleton of this kit is amazing. Made from ABS plastic and fully articulated with all the hydraulic pistons molded in metal-like chrome. This skeleton system is similar to that found in the new MG G Gundam kit and is very sturdy without the tendency to slip like earlier kits. The covering armor is totally removable and easily attached.All parts are pre-colored and like all other PG kits it simply snaps and screw together. However painting of the parts will greatly enhance the appearance.This is Bandai's most amazing kit to date. I wonder what they will do for an encore?",
