The head and neck can be articulated in four axes, allowing for various dynamic poses such as tilting the chin or looking up towards the sky.The Barbatos is equipped with a wide range of motion achieved by incorporating movable axes within the torso, enabling swinging from left to right and forward and backward tilting. The movement of the chest is synchronized with the expansion and contraction of the side abdominal cylinders. The shoulder connection utilizes a swing mechanism, enhancing the range of motion for the arms. The cylinder on the elbow moves in tandem with the arm, providing synchronized articulation.Featuring the unique MGSD original gimmick, pulling down the lower part of the shoulder armor activates the linked expansion of the central armor. The knee armor moves in conjunction with the bending of the legs, while the armor on the back of the knee can move independently without hindering the leg's motion.The twin eyes are created using a double-layer structure, combining intricately detailed internal parts with clear parts for a stunning visual effect.MGSD original clear parts with precision-shaped processing, designed to efficiently reflect light, are employed on the chest, knees, and shoulders, introducing a shining technique.The Barbatos also utilizes the \"Real Metallic Gloss Injection\" material in glossy injection molding, enhancing the metallic sheen on the fine details.The backpack allows for mounting a sword, a 300mm smoothbore gun, and a mace. The 300mm smoothbore gun can be transformed into a storage state by extending the barrel and rotating it 180 degrees.The mace features an MGSD original gimmick where pushing the handle extends the tip and unfolds four blades in synchronized motion.[Included Accessories]Mace x 1Sword x 1300mm Smoothbore Gun x 1Joint Parts Set x 1Marking Sticker Sheet x 1Please note that the first release of this item may be limited, and in some cases it may not be possible to fill all orders at the time of its initial release.

The PG Unleashed RX-78-2 Gundam is history-making in its number of gimmicks and new technologies, resulting in a splendid build like you've never seen before!It features the Gunpla Evolution Link System, which adopts a step-by-step assembly process to simulate the experience of building a real Mobile Suit! Its internal frame, which serves as its skeleton, is assembled in the earliest stage in the history of the Perfect Grade lineup, and it's also the largest frame in the history of Gunpla, with a total height of about 18cm. The kit will have over 90 points of articulation after assembly -- the largest number of joints in Gunpla history! -- for extreme posability! Its fuselage, which uses a core block mechanism, uses a new structure that combines 40 joints.\u00a0Metallic molding color and plated parts are used for the multi-layer truss frame to create four distinct metallic expressions; three kinds of secondary processing such as silver plating, matte plating and chrome plating are combined with metal parts and newly developed etched seals to make the Gundam look even more amazing than ever before.In addition, this kit is equipped with the most full-body open-hatch gimmicks ever seen in a Gundam kit, and it also includes a new LED unit! The unit includes a new compact RGB two-lamp type LED light that enables color change, and a design that maximizes its efficiency. A very small lighting unit is also installed in the beam saber! The beam blade will be lit from the base in a gradation for ultimate realism. A pin-type BR435 lithium battery (one test battery included) and two LR41 button-cell batteries (not included, sold separately) are required for the light effects.Don't miss out on this ultimate Gundam kit -- order yours now![Includes]:Beam rifleBeam saber (x2)LED beam saberShieldCore fighterRBG 2-lamp LEDInterchangeable hands, left and right (x4 each)Figure (x4) (Amuro standing x1, sitting x2; Seira standing)Metal parts for vernier (x2)Metal parts for Vulcan (x2)Saber assembly auxiliary jigPin-type BR435 lithium batter for testMagnet unitMetal plate for magnet (x2)Marking stickerName sealEtching stickerMetallic 3D stickerInstruction manual",
