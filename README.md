# Haro

Haro is a little discord bot that lets people organise group buys more easily. We're making this because arranging and managing group buys while also keeping track of things is just a littlet too annoying.

## Planned features

The basic features that we have planned for the project are as follows.

- [ ] Personalised wishlists for users to query in multiple ways in order to find people who might want a certain kit.
- [ ] MSRP-wise %-age based breakdown of user-input items.
- [ ] Generating all text and a user interface to keep track of everything easily.
- [ ] Calculating whether a certain set of items can be shipped together using a certain shipping method.
- [x] Support for multiple websites for sources (Hobbylink Japan and Banzaihobby supported so far).

More advanced functionalities that could be added later (very optional for now):

- [ ] Completely automate group buy management. Keep track of who called what (needs more functionality to be priority).
- [ ] Image recognition from listings to generate list of items automatically.
- [ ] Estimation of deal prices along with passing a judgement on whether it is worth as a group, solo, or not at all

## More information

The entire project is being developed in python. Your feedback and more feature suggestions are appreciated.
